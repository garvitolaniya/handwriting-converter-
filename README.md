# this will help to streamline the process of data collection for the handwriting repicator 

NOTE: this is not a text ot word converter unlike others 

this will store the smaples of your handwriting and use the same as training data for training the model
the training data includes:
1. all 26 aplhabets sample
2. all the numbericals digits from 0 to 9
3. all the special case symbols
 all the letters present on the keyboard

this will also be capable ot understand the way you write 
as the input data also include some sentenses smaples to sense one's flow of handwriting 

it is different from most of the present date handwriting converters present on internet, 
present date handwriting converts are text to word converters they convert word by word to handwritings trained upon 
its more of a personalized one!


SUMMARY:
first model needs to be trained upon ones handwriting technique (this includes all the writing habits such as letter writing, spacing between letters, etc. )
